# HubSpot Custom Workflow for Email Verification using Kickbox API
<p>
  Workflow Overview:
This custom HubSpot workflow, crafted in JavaScript, is a powerful tool for validating email addresses using the Kickbox API. The process seamlessly integrates with HubSpot, retrieving emails from the CRM input fields, and leveraging Kickbox to perform email verification. </p>
<p>
  Implementation Steps:

1. Secure HubSpot API Key: Obtain a private app key to ensure secure access to the HubSpot API.
2. Kickbox Integration: Obtain the Kickbox LIVE API key(the test key didn't work for me for some reason).
3. Deploy Custom JavaScript Code
4. Copy Custom: Coded Output to a Custom Property
